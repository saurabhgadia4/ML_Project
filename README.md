• The goal  was to predict the hourly rain gauge measurement for given polarimetric radar readings.

• We developed a pipeline for data cleaning, data visualization, feature selection, hyper-parameter tuning of individual learning models.

• Designed and implemented ensemble learning model comprising of tuned Gradient Boosting , SVM, extra tree regressors as its components for final predictions.
